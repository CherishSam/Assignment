        <p>
            Swinging in the backyard, pull up in your fast car<br>
            Whistling my name<br>
            Open up a beer and you say, "Get over here"<br>
            And play a video game<br>
            I'm in his favorite sundress, watching me get undressed<br>
            Take that body downtown<br>
            I say, "You the bestest," lean in for a big kiss, put his favorite perfume on<br>
            "Go play your video game"<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h1>[Chorus]</h1>
         It's you, it's you, it's all for you, everything I do<br>
         I tell you all the time, Heaven is a place on Earth with you<br>
         Tell me all the things you wanna do<br>
         I heard that you like the bad girls, honey, is that true?<br>
         It's better than I ever even knew<br>
         They say that the world was built for two<br>
         Only worth living if somebody is loving you<br>
         And baby, now you do<br>
      </p>
       <p>
        <h1>
        [Post-Chorus]
        </h1>
        Mmm
         </p>
        <p>
         <h1>[Verse 2]</h1>
         Singin' in the old bars, swinging with the old stars<br>
         Livin' for the fame<br>
         Kissin' in the blue dark, playing pool and wild darts<br>
         Video games<br>
         He holds me in his big arms, drunk, and I am seeing stars<br>
         This is all I think of<br>
         Watchin' all our friends fall in and out of Old Paul's, this is my idea of fun<br>
         Playin' video games<br>
         </p>
         <p>
            <h1>[Chorus]</h1>
             It's you, it's you, it's all for you, everything I do<br>

             Tell me all the things you wanna do<br>
             I heard that you like the bad girls, honey, is that true?<br>

          <p>
          <h1>[Post-Chorus]</h1>
          (N-now you do, now you do, now you do)<br>
